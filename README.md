This project is a data repository for project 2. In this project, we are using data from the Coffee Quality Database to identify features of coffee batches that influence whether they are classified as good or poor. The results of our analysis will be used to advise farmers on how they can approve their crop. A generalized linear model approach is utilized. All code relevant to the final presentation is available in the file "Group_9_Analysis.RMD." This code imports the data, performs exploratory analysis and data visualization, and conducts a formal analysis including sensitivity analyses. Tables and charts generated by the code are contained in the knitted pdf file "Group_9_Analysis.pdf."
