This is a data repository for a project using data from the Coffee Quality Database to identify features of coffee batches that influence whether they are classified as good or poor. The variables under consideration are the country of origin, aroma grade, flavor grade, acidity grade, the number of category type 2 defects in the batch, average altitude on the farm at which the coffee was grown, and the year in which the batch was harvested. The primary outcome of interest is the classification of the batch as either good or poor.

The results of our analysis will be used to advise farmers on how they can improve their crops. A generalized linear model approach is utilized. All code relevant to the final presentation is available in the file "Group_9_Analysis.RMD." This code imports the data, performs exploratory analyses, generates data visualizations, and conducts a formal analysis including sensitivity analyses. Tables and charts generated by the code are contained in the knitted pdf file "Group_9_Analysis.pdf." Finally, the Bibliography folder contains a file with the two references used in the presentation and the Miscellaneous Files folder contains other files not directly relevant to the final analysis.
