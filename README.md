This project is a data repository for project 2. In this project, we are using data from the Coffee Quality Database to identify features of coffee batches that influence whether they are classified as good or poor for use by farmers. A generalized linear model approach is utilized. All code relevant to the final presentation is available in the file "Group_9_Analysis.RMD." Tables and charts generated by the code are containted in the knitted pdf file "Group_9_Analysis.pdf."
